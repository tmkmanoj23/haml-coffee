# Haml Coffee Templates

Haml Coffee was initially developed in early 2011 by [Sebastion Deutsch](https://github.com/netzpirat)
and [Jan Varwig](https://github.com/janv). Since that time maintenance and further development is done
by [Michael Kessler](https://github.com/netzpirat) and thus Haml-Coffee found a new home at
[https://github.com/netzpirat/haml-coffee](https://github.com/netzpirat/haml-coffee).
